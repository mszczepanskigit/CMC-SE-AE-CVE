# Estimating Option with discounted payoff at time 1 using Monte Carlo Methods with reducing variation
Estimating Integrals using:

 - Crude Monte Carlo estimator

 - Stratified estimator

 - Antithetic estimator

 - Control variate estimator

All methods provide a reduction variation method to increase the estimate result.

In *Estimating_Options_with_Monte_Carlo_methods.pdf* file you can find whole description and all computations.
